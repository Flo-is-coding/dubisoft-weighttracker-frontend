# weighttracker
Welcome to my first coding project.

While developing the goal is to learn coding starting with HTML, CSS and basic JS.
Because of the circumstance that I am currently also trying to lose weight the idea of a weighttracker came up to my mind.
The basic function is to track my weight every morning while also tracking extra information which may influenz the weight messurement.
Till now you can submit a weight only once a day to prevent useless or irritating datapoints to get saved in the DB.

Future ideas are for example a streak future displaying the amount of days in which weight has been tracked consecutively.
Also the idea is to analyse the collected data at some point by visualizations e.g. using embedded PowerBI.

Below you can see a screenshot of the first prototype.
